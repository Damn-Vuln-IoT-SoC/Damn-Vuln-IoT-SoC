Damn Vuln IoT SoC
=================

This project is educative plateform that aims at developing a generator of vulnerable, configurable and easily usable Systems-on-Chip (SoC). It is intended for users wishing to train themselves to exploit or correct vulnerabilities in the context of hardware security, this platform can be used as course material or for CTF.

The following documentation will guide you through the installation and configuration of the development environment required for this project.

Hardware and software used for the project
------------------------------------------

.. warning::

   Since it's an educational platform we decided to use a Digilent Basys3 board since it's a popular and inexpensive board, but the project can easily be adapted to many other FPGA boards.

- OS : Ubuntu 20.04
- LiteX (Tag : 2022.08)
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Digilent Basys3 FPGA board (can be another one)
